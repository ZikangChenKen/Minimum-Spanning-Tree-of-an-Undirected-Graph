# Minimum-Spanning-Tree-of-an-Undirected-Graph
This repo focus on the problem of ﬁnding a minimum spanning tree of an undirected graph.

Implemented a parallel algorithm for ﬁnding the minimum spanning tree of an undirected graph using whatever parallel Java primitives you have learned in this class — standard Java threads, java.util.concurrent libraries, HJ library, or some (carefully selected) combination thereof.
